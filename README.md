# warranty-sticker-check
Needed a way to go through a bin of laptop assets and mark any units that have warranty coverage with a sticker
Levering Google Sheets API via gspread, pull my uo-to-date Google Sheet of units and their warranty status. Pull that data into a list of lists. With a tKinter GUI, scan laptop asset tag, GUI will display green if a sticker is needed, red if it is not, or yellow if the info is not on the list
